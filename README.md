# Ventilated Brake Disk Design 🏎️

## Objective
To design a ventilated and drilled brake rotor using SolidWorks to understand thermal management geometry in automotive braking systems.

## Tools Used
 Software: SolidWorks 2022
 Features: Extrude Boss/Base, Revolve, Cut-Extrude, Circular Pattern, Fillet.

## Methodology
1.  Hub Design: Created the central mounting hub with bolt patterns.
2.  Venting:Designed internal vanes to allow airflow for cooling (convection).
3.  Drilling: Applied a circular pattern of cross-drilled holes to aid in gas dissipation and weight reduction.
4.  Material Selection: Modeled as Grey Cast Iron (standard automotive material).
